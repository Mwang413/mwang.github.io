THis project is an introductory analysis of data on thousands of collected YouTube videos' stats.

This project uses Python to clean and present the data in-depth through various stastical methods.

Simple Ordinary Least Square models are built for some of the attributes within the data, such as a video's likes, dislikes and comments.

Please enjoy the many graphs and stat-phile things.
